# MapReduce

MapReduce algorithm implemented in JavaScript.

The `test` function runs everything smoothly, I provided 2 text files as examples.
As I am not an expert of JavaScript, I used NodeJs to easily open the file which contains the text for the demo, sorry about this.

Run with `node mapreduce.js`.
